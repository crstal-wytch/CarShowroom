							<h4>BMW X1 first 1,000 miles</h4>
							<p>by Planenut from Palm Harbor, FL | April 2, 2013 </p>
							<p>I replaced my 325 ixt wagon with a new X1. The cars have allot 
							in common and it feels familiar from the first drive. The hardest
							thing to get used to is the engine shutoff feature when you come to 
							a stop. It is unnerving, annoying and you must remember to defeat it 
							at startup by pressing a button as the shutdown feature is the default 
							setting. My dealer just told me that there is a way for the service department
							to re-program the car to permanently disable this and I plan on doing that soon.
							The additional ride height is welcome as a daily driver is exposed to high curbs, 
							parking stops and entrance aprons that can bottom out most performance cars, yet it does not seem to affect 
							the handling as the X1 is still much lower with a fairly low CG compared to the larger SUV's.
							The X1 is still fun to drive, can accelerate surprisingly quickly and can be tossed
							into corners and keep it's composure. The seating position has more room than the
							older 3 series and lots of legroom. My criticisms are minor. I miss the separately
							opening window in the tailgate that the wagon has. I also would like the rear 
							compartment to extend back a few more inches, after all this is not a car that will be used for heavy 
							off-road use so exit angle for rough terrain is not really a consideration, so there is no need to 
							chop the back so short. Also, the roof rails are the new aero styled type that renders all of my 
							Yakima products obsolete, so it will require buying all new attachments and crossbars for the new 
							style. Overall, the X1 is a great all around, versatile daily driver. For the BMW purists, you will
							miss the sound and smoothness of the traditional inline six, but the twin turboed
							4 works great, just a little raspier, and the 8 speed autobox is really 
							surprisingly versatile from just cruising to spirited driving, the transmission 
							reads your mind.</p>

							<h4>Front End Problems</h4>
							<p>by EA from central Pennsylvania | February 10, 2013 </p>
							<p>I have been driving for more than 45 years, but luckily have never been in an accident with
							another vehicle. Until I got my X1 (with the larger of the two engine options), I have never 
							needed to replace rims on any car I owned, including a 4 previous BMW models. Now I been told
							I have t replace the two front rims because they are damaged. One was my fault. I ran over a 
							sloped curb installed as a median on a two lane street and then returned to my lane. It sounded 
							terrible, and when I inspected the tire, it had a bubble and I replaced it. On the right side, I 
							went over a common pothole. Now I find the tire on that side has a small bubble and a bent rim. I 
							think with the larger engine, the shock absorption is totally inadequate on this model. On another 
							issue, if you drop something like a credit car or keys between either front seat and the center
							console, good luck getting it out without cutting yourself. The engineers must know the space is tight,
							so why so many sharp edges when you reach down. I don't expect either of the problems I mentioned with 
							a $43000 car. The car has great acceleration and wonderful breaking. The steering is responsive and the 
							car is fun to drive. The xdrive computer system was not designed for use while actually driving.</p>
							<p><br /></p>
							<h4>Terrific vehicle</h4>
							<p>by First BMW from Schererville, IN | January 18, 2013 </p>
							<p>Very good looking, very comfortable. Lots of bells and whistles. Steers and corners well.
							heated seats and steering wheel are terrific.</p>
